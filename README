This file explains how to run the system.


INITIALIZATION
--------------

1) Use ant to compile and build the project using the command : ant build

2) Use init.sh in order to start a client or router
	- We have hardcoded the IP addresses of machines in CSIL which we used for testing and deployment.
	- The script takes one argument at a time:
		./init.sh r	
			starts up the router		
		./init.sh <client_id>
			where <client_id> is an integer (0 to 4)
		    specifying the logical address of a client		
	- Run each configuration of the script at different machines.
	  Look at hosts.txt to know the IP of the clients and router that we have configured.
	  
3) We use Apache log4j for logging. 
   Log files depicting communication between client <-> client and client <-> router
   can be found at the following locations :
        - Client : /var/tmp/client_dict.log
        - Controller : /var/tmp/controller_dict.log
        - Router : /var/tmp/router_dict.log
   The above locations of log files can be changed in the log4j conf file : log_configuration.dat
   


COMMANDS

5) delete key
		Deletes the key-value pair with the given key from the dictionary
